### *If you struggle with headaches or migraines on a regular basis, read closely – this story could change your life!*

My headaches started in my early 40s. Of course, I’d had headaches before – but when they began happening daily, I started to freak out.

I assumed it was stress at first… but **the pain simply didn’t stop**. In fact, it got worse.

Eventually, **my headaches felt like they were in control of my entire life**. My work suffered. I felt less present with my family. I was completely drained of energy all the time.

After a few months of mild, but constant pain every day, I went to the doctor… who gave me drugs to ease the symptoms. I accepted this solution at first – what else was I going to do?

But after a few years, **I got extremely tired of taking pills every day**. They made me feel groggy and weak – and with each pill I popped, it became harder and harder to imagine ever getting off of them.

So I started looking for new solutions. However, **every “alternative solution” I tried (like yoga, massages, even a back brace) simply didn’t relieve the pain like the pills did.**

I was stuck: Do I accept essentially being a “legal drug addict”? Or do I accept a life filled with constant pain? **It felt like no matter what I did, I would only live my life halfway.**

**Have you been through something like this?**

But then I received a phone call from my sister. She was ecstatic, practically begging me to come over as soon as possible. When I arrived, she showed me a strange-looking device and told me to put it on my head.

“What the heck is it?” I asked.

“It’s called the [TheraICE Headache Relief Cap](https://t.gadgetadvisers.com/click),” she explained. “It’s a new device that uses hot & cold compression therapy to **relieve headaches in minutes – and it’s completely natural**. My husband just got one and he loves it… so I immediately thought of you.”

Well, I’ll be darned if I didn’t snatch that weird contraption right out of her hands before she even finished the sentence… and **OH MY! I’ve never felt pain melt away so quickly!**

## What is the [TheraICE Headache Relief Cap](https://t.gadgetadvisers.com/click)?

The Headache Relief Cap is a **patent-pending hot and cold therapy device** that provides **natural relief for all types of headaches**.

[![](/theraice/g12.jpg)](https://t.gadgetadvisers.com/click)

It’s unique for three main reasons:

1. It provides **both hot and cold therapy** in one easy-to-use device.
2. It’s the world’s first headache solution to provide **360-degree head coverage**, giving you maximum relief.
3. It’s made from dark materials, which naturally **block out sunlight** – a common cause of headaches.

Combined, this “pain relief trifecta” makes the Headache Relief Cap a must-have for anyone who experiences headaches regularly.

Personally, I use the **doctor-approved cold compression therapy** most often – the Headache Relief Cap’s thermal insulation allows it to **stay cold 10x longer than a wet washcloth**, meaning it actually stays cold long enough for my headaches to disappear.

That said, I also use the heat therapy to relax when I’m feeling particularly tense. It’s great to have both options available!

## Here’s how it works

Here’s the thing: Before the Headache Relief Cap, I had already tried cold compression with mediocre results… so I was confused. “Why does the Headache Relief Cap work so well for me when the other options don’t?!”

As it turns out, the Headache Relief Cap’s **360° stretchable compression design** makes a big difference. Because it wraps around your entire head, it’s able to evenly distribute the compression – allowing it to hit all the important headache relief points on your head for maximum relief.

Finally, the **fact that it blocks out sunlight is huge**. As you’re likely aware, intense light can cause headaches (or at least make them worse). Not only do the dark materials keep this sunlight from bothering me, it enhances the overall relaxation I feel. 

Using the Headache Relief Cap couldn’t be easier:

**To use the cold therapy**, simply take your Headache Relief Cap out of the freezer, easily slide it onto your head, relax for 15 minutes and enjoy the relief!

**To use the hot therapy**, simply microwave your Headache Relief Cap for 10 seconds. If you’d like it a bit warmer, keep zapping it in 5-second increments. When it’s at the desired temperature, just slide it on.

## What types of pain can the Headache Relief Cap help with?

The Headache Relief Cap’s “dual therapy” technique is **extremely effective for relieving all sorts of head and facial pain** – including:

- Headaches
- Inflammation
- Eye, Cranial, & Facial Tension
- Sinus & Stress Relief 
- Puffy Eyes

Even better, the [Headache Relief Cap](https://t.gadgetadvisers.com/click) is made with **buttery-soft fabric that breathes easy** – to me, it feels like a **“cool pillow” around your head…** which feels incredible when your head is pounding.

[![](/theraice/featured-in.jpg)](https://t.gadgetadvisers.com/click)

The **one-size-fits-all design** makes the [Headache Relief Cap](https://t.gadgetadvisers.com/click) a convenient solution for both kids and adults. It’s 100% safe to use (even on bare skin) and there’s no uncomfortable velcro, hard inserts, **or ice** to fuss with.

I can’t express how happy I am that my doctor recommended the Headache Relief Cap… I honestly never thought I’d be free from headaches.

I’m so glad I found the Headache Relief Cap. I highly recommend it to ANYONE with chronic headaches!

And of course, I’m not entirely free. **I still get headaches regularly… but now I have a powerful, natural way to relieve them in seconds.** It makes a world of difference.

Bottom line: **If you or a loved one suffers from headaches on a regular basis, then you absolutely HAVE to experience the Headache Relief Cap for yourself.**
