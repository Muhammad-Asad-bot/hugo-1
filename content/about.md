Hello, welcome to our website!

Gadget Advisers pop up from some geeky friends, including engineers and tech enthusiasts who have always loved reading and researching all the new technologies and gadgets online. 

Our passion for discovering new objects that can help us around the house grows more and more every year. We joke all the time about how we are that friend or nephew or cousin who helps when people have tech problems, or when they find something new online to buy, but are concerned about the quality and provenance of the products. 

One day, at one of our meetings, we had the idea of turning all that information we exchanged with friends and family into something more serious, and help more people. It was when we decided to start Gadget Advisers.

Here we show you the best products we've found online. We believe that the content you will find here may help you with your daily problems at home, make your life easier and funnier. 

We are happy that you are here and that there are so many people who are part of the tech and gadget lovers community. Hope you enjoy browsing our website. Any questions please contact us, we will be happy to assist you.
