In 2021, anyone who says they need glue simply hasn’t heard of Bondic yet! This new adhesive makes it easy to **fix virtually anything** — without making a mess or worrying about it breaking after a few days. All you have to do is apply Bondic using the pen-shaped device, then shine the safe UV light on it. Bondic won’t form its rock-solid bond until you’ve shined the light, so you can reshape it over and over until you get it just right. It’s absolutely amazing for DIYers… it won’t be long before glue is a thing of the past!

- Bondic is **50X stronger than glue**. It’s designed to last forever!
- Works on any and all surfaces – metal, wood, glass, plastic, ceramics – you name it!
- **Never leaves a mess or sticky fingers behind** — only bonds when exposed to UV light!
- Won’t dry out since it’s not a glue. Melt and reuse over and over and over!
- **Completely safe to use**, non-toxic, and no heat required!
