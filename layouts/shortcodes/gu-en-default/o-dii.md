Anyone can use ODii to easily grip and grab any items no matter where they fall thanks to its **long, strong, retractable arm** that can reach between car seats, down drains, and countless other places. It even comes with a handy flashlight to see where you’re going!

- Fits into the tightest of spaces where your hands and arms would never fit
- Includes a **bright flashlight and powerful 23-inch magnet**
- Shrinks down for super easy storage
- **Perfect for every toolkit**, home, and car
