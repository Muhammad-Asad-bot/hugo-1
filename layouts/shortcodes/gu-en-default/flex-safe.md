FlexSafe is a portable, flexible safe that **prevents your most important belongings from being stolen**. Just hook it to your chair, your car, even your belt… and nobody can walk away with it! When this device premiered on Shark Tank, one of the things that really wowed the sharks was that the FlexSafe is RFID-proof – meaning people can’t use radiofrequency to retrieve your data from afar. Its material is also slash-proof and the combination lock is reprogrammable. Nobody is getting into this thing!

- Easy to use – **just hook it, lock it, and relax** knowing your valuables are safe!
- Lasts a lifetime thanks to its extremely durable 5-layer construction
- **Corrosion resistant**, heavy duty Nickel Alloy lock is extremely secure
- Voted “Hotel Product of the Year”
- **Compact design** means you can take it anywhere
