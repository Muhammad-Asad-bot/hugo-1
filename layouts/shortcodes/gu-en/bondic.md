**Problem**: getting frustated every time something breaks at home because you don't know how to fix but also dont want to throw them away

**Solution**: Bondic

Don't throw away your broken glasses or leaky plumbing just yet! Bondic allows you to refile holes in the piping of a sink, fixing eyeglasses by applying its liquid formula. It's so strong that it will last forever. Just apply the unique liquid formula to the damaged area, shine the special UV light on it for only 4 seconds, and voila! The liquid freezes into a rock-solid layer of clear plastic on your command!

Bondic is non-toxic and safe for everyone, including children and pets, use it around the house, no problem.
