**Problem**: Did you know your toothbrush is the 3rd most contaminated object in your entire home? and likely has 100 million nasty germs crawling all over it right now?

**Solution**: Bril

Bril is a portable toothbrush case that uses natural UV light to kill germs on the head of your toothbrush â€“ protecting you and your family from germs, viruses and harmful bacteria.

It uses the same UV sterilizing technology trusted by hospitals & the International Space Station, and it is strongly recommended for adults, kids, seniors, or anyone that wants a happier, healthier smile.
